                            Simply put, a project, is exactly what it sounds like. That is, some work we are going to
                            do together. It would probably make sense to have one project per 'room', but its entirely
                            up to you. A project is really a collection of work, schemes, images, tasks, events, chats
                            and anything else that happens during the course of your interior design journey with us.

                            It just gives us a way to keep everything neat and together. You can create as many projects
                            as you want, you only have to submit the ones you want us to help you with. The system is free
                            to use as much as you want, you only pay for our design work!
